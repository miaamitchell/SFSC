# Pre-Semester Check-In Tool
Description
-----------
This project was developed for USI's Senior Software Development course. Built for USI's Student Financial Success Center, this project aimed to put their existing Excel tool into a web environment for easy use by current and prospective students. Using a form to gather user input, the program will then parse the existing Fees.xlsx file and calculate their estimated cost/rebate for the upcoming semester. Because the project had to live within their Umbraco CMS, JavaScript and HTML/CSS were used to create the project. Server-side scripts and other add-ons were not an option as they would require additional approvals which would exceed the project's designated timeframe.
